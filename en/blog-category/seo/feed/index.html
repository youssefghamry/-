										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Those days are long gone when social media was used only by adults to keep in touch with their friends and families. Social media was not a tool for business. It was not on any business owner’s mind. But today in the world full of technology it has become such a common fixture in our society that we use it without giving it a second thought. It is very rare to listen “I have no time to use the phone”. Social media has transformed, it is no longer an entertainment-only platform. Now, it has become an important business tool. If you are a marketer then you need to participate in social feeds by providing your content and captivating image because you have only a few seconds to grab someone’s attention. Have you ever thought if you are not a part of social media feed, then do you even exist? Not convinced? Consider below some fascinating reasons how social media impacts your business.</p>
<h3>1.Cost-effective</h3>
<p>Social media marketing is free because there is no entry cost. You can build an empire with free profiles. If you want to advertise on Facebook and Twitter then you may pay to promote, but a small as compared to traditional marketing methods. SMM gives you the flexibility to pay as much or as little as you like while allowing you to have all the functions of a business page. Ads on social media also give you the flexibility to choose how much you want to spend depending on how long you wish to run, you can even choose your targeted audience. All you need is to give your little time. Recently according to some study, 84% of marketers found as little as six hours of work on their social sites per week were enough to generate increased traffic.</p>
<h3>2.Build brand awareness</h3>
<p>In the digital world, it is very important to build brand awareness among people. Social media is the best way to do the same. It helps to get your brand in front of your audiences. Brand awareness becomes critical when you’re in the early stages of building your company. If people are not aware of your brand then do you even exist? How can you get new customers to buy from you if they are not aware of you? Social sites are like an extension for you. You can use it for free and present your company before potential customers. You have a website and can be searched, your social networks make it easier for customers to find you.</p>
<h3>3.Engage directly with customers</h3>
<p>Social Media is the best communication tool which works in your favor because your existing and potential customers are already on these sites. You can communicate directly with customers. It allows you to reach them privately or publicly via commenting. They can share their experience with your business freely. In return, it gives you the complete opportunity to respond accordingly. Your industry may determine which social media network holds the most potential value for your business (social media may vary according to your business). All you need to do is simple market research so you can determine which social networks your target audience uses most.</p>
<h3>4.Gain Customer Insights</h3>
<p>Through social media you can easily view customer insights. What your buyers are looking for and what they like. So you can build your strategy based on these insights. Here you don’t need to guess about your customer’s choice and needs. Social networks can enable you to hear exactly what people are saying about your brand — what they love, what they think you can do better and what they hate. With real feedback from your customers, you can make appropriate business decisions.</p>
<h3>5.Enhances your Search Engine Rankings</h3>
<p>For better search engine rankings quality content and its visibility is must. Social media can help you with this. With a click of share button, users can share content across their social media channels, therefore increasing the number of inbound links to the content on your website. As your content becomes much easier to share, you are increasing your chances of creating quality backlinks. Social media plays a vital role in boosting your SEO rankings.</p>
<p>So these are the five impelling reasons we’ve listed above should help you understand exactly why social media is important. Social media has huge benefits, so there’s no reason to not try to build at least a small social media presence for your business. Social media networks have become a core part of a successful business advertising plan. If already having social media presence then make sure you are using to your full advantage.
