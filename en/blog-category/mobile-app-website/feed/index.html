										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mobile app development v/s Mobile website development can be an intense debate. With the emergence of technology in contemporary world, website has become the core necessity of any organization. Designing a website for mobile devices is more important than ever. Organizations are re – thinking their mobile strategy as the app usage of mobile has exceeded has the usage of desktop. So if you have not yet decided to build a website that can be accessed through mobile devices, it is the time to do so.</p>
<p>One of the first considerations that will likely come to mind while establishing a mobile presence for your business or organization is whether you want to create a mobile website or a mobile application for users to download (app), or perhaps both. Many people assert that you don’t need a mobile app, you just need a website that looks good on mobile devices, on the other hand some people say that mobile apps have benefits that a website cannot provide. Mobile websites and apps can look very similar at first-glance, however when digging a little deeper, there are a multiple factors that need to be considered before deciding like available budget, intended purpose and required features, including target audiences. Both of them have their dedicated marketplace and own certain number of pros and cons.</p>
<h3>Mobile App v/s Mobile Web: What’s The Difference?</h3>
<p>Before evaluating the advantages of mobile app development v/s mobile website development it is important to understand the difference between them. Both app and web can be acquired through mobile or any handheld device such as tablet. A mobile website is exactly as it sounds. A mobile website usually is not a separate site, it is similar to any other website in that it consists of browser-based HTML pages that are connected together and accessed via Internet (for mobile typically Wi-Fi or 3G or 4G networks). The salient characteristic that distinguishes a mobile website from a standard website is that it is designed for the smaller handheld display and touch-screen interface (smart phones &amp; tablets).</p>
<p>Increasingly, responsive web design is becoming the new standard for websites as they are designed for different platforms and adjust to different screen sizes and layouts from desktop to tablets and smart phones. Like traditional websites, user can see content, images and videos on mobile website, but it is optimized for smaller screens. In addition user can also access mobile-specific features such as click-to-call or location-based mapping from mobile website.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Mobile apps are applications that are downloaded and installed on a user’s mobile device rather than being rendered on a search engines. For any given operating system users can download app by visiting device-specific portals such as Apple’s App Store or Android Market. Like a website, app fetches data and content from internet or user can download it and access it later without internet connection.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-4694 aligncenter" src="https://ygbrandmaker.site/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/mobile-app-development-vs-mobile-website-development-image-1.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="402" srcset="https://ygbrandmaker.site/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/mobile-app-development-vs-mobile-website-development-image-1.jpg 800w, https://ygbrandmaker.site/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/mobile-app-development-vs-mobile-website-development-image-1-300x151.jpg 300w, https://ygbrandmaker.site/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/mobile-app-development-vs-mobile-website-development-image-1-768x386.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<h3>Mobile website development pros</h3>
<p>If your goal is related to brand marketing and target your potential audiences then mobile/responsive website is the foremost option in your mobile outreach strategy. As it has numerous advantages over app development and are discussed below –</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile/ responsive websites are compatible for all screen size devices.</li>
<li>Mobile websites can be founded easily.</li>
<li>Mobile websites can be shared among users or publishers.</li>
<li>Mobile websites have broader reach among audience.</li>
<li>Mobile websites are easier and cost effective.</li>
<li>Brand visibility and SEO.</li>
<li>Mobile websites cannot be deleted.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mobile app development pros</h3>
<p>An app is written in the language of the operating system of the device and developed for specific platform such as android and iOS. App is a completely separate entity from a company’s website, and is often an extension of a brand. For making interactive games, an app makes a sense. Let’s have a look of mobile app pros –</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobile app can be accessed anytime and anywhere, without internet also.</li>
<li>An app can interface with the device’s features and hardware, such as the camera, GPS location.</li>
<li>Mobile app allows user to set up their preferences at the time of installation.</li>
<li>If your target audiences are going to use your app in a personalized fashion on a regular basis (think EverNote, photo editor) then an app is a great way to do that.</li>
<li>Mobile app offers a completely different experience for the user and has ability to offer new branding opportunities.</li>
<li>Mobile apps allow for more interactive ways for the user to engage with your content.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google states that “61% of users are unlikely to return to a mobile website they had trouble accessing and over 40% visit a competitor’s site instead.” Due to poor functionality, you’re sending your customers directly to your competition that provides a better mobile experience.</p>
<h3>Which is better option?</h3>
<p>Now if you have to decide what to build mobile app or mobile website then have look on your business primary goals. If your aim is to offer mobile friendly content to large audience and establish mobile presence that can be easily maintained and shared among people, found on search engines then mobile – friendly/ responsive website is logical choice to go. On the other hand, if you aim to provide a user experience like gaming interface, user engagement and communicate your customers than mobile app is going to make sense.</p>
<p>It’s also important to remember that a mobile/responsive website and a native app are not necessarily mutually exclusive. If done correctly, both can be a strategic and effective choice. Many organizations have both a mobile-friendly public website for their general web presence, as well as a downloadable app to accommodate more specific requirements. In the end, it’s all about choosing the right tool to achieve your business objectives.</p>

These choices, initially will feel like a windfall, can quickly feel overwhelming due to the multitude eCommerce options available. In this blog, we will go through one very popular solution and present an overview of what is WooCommerce and why you should consider it for creating an e-commerce website.</p>
<h3>What is WooCommerce?</h3>
<p>WooCommerce is the free plugin, or functional extension WordPress eCommerce plugin for quite some time. It has been downloaded over thirteen million times and supports more than a million active installs. As per research, it covers more than a third of the entire online shop market. Automattic purchased WooCommerce has increased the number of WooCommerce operators. WooCommerce is installed into a WordPress website and adds in order processing, shopping cart functionality and basic product management. With the help of WooCommerce, you can create a basic online store and sell a variety of products and services which include goods (both physical and digital), ongoing memberships and affiliate transactions. The core software present in it manages vital e-commerce features like inventory management, international customers, shipping cost calculations, coupons and sales tax management. The base functionality of WooCommerce can be elevated with over three hundred extensions that can add in additional features such as composite products, bookings, EU VAT calculations and tracking, returns and warranties, customer documentation, product bundles, as well as a number of learning management systems for selling courses.</p>
<p>WooCommerce was originally created in September of 2011 by the team at WooThemes. Later in May 2015, WooThemes was purchased by Automattic and WooCommerce was placed within the Automattic family of products. There are more than 300 contributors to the WooCommerce code base. There are many WordPress agencies and developers working beside the WooCommerce team to build plugin extensions and stock website templates for storefront presentation, perform storefront installation and set up for clients, as well as offer custom code and theme tweaks.</p>
<h3>WooCommerce’s Pros and Cons</h3>
<p>WooCommerce is the most customizable eCommerce platform for building your online business. Just like any piece of software, WooCommerce has a range of pros and cons when working with it. These differ by individual, but they should be considered before selecting WooCommerce as your eCommerce solution.</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>

<li>Virtually every storefront will require an extension and these plugins cost money and require an annual license purchase.</li>
<li>WordPress.org has a support forum which is not well maintained.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From last few years, eCommerce sites and apps are expanding rapidly with huge success. With this payment gateways are also in demand. Nowadays making an online payment on a website is not a tough task for people. According to a recent study, around 60 percent people wish to be their favored payment method when making a purchase and 85 percent of people do payment via credit or debit cards. A payment gateway is a software application that bridges a gap between an eCommerce website and the bank that authorizes (or declines) a customer’s credit card payment. It simply helps in the processing of credit cards and assures the payment is done. Credit and debit cards, eCheck (ACH), and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are all processed through payment gateways. It acts like a connecting pipe, through which transactions can be done automatically from the customer to the retailer. So, it is the final step of the sales process on an ecommerce website. Some recognized payment gateways are PayPal, BrainTree, Amazon Payments, PayU, Stripe etc.</p>
<p>When you’re setting up your e-commerce store, selecting the right payment gateway for your business is one of the vital decisions you make. It influences how much it costs you to do business, as well as how customers feel about buying from your eCommerce store. If it works well and gains trust, that in turn amplifies your bottom line. By implementing payment gateways in your eCommerce store, it becomes easy to accept several types of electronic payments. Finding the payment gateway which accurately matches your business will be a time-consuming process with a huge list of choices. As there are many factors to keep in mind when making your eCommerce Payment Gateway selection. In this blog, factors are described so that you can think through.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-4625 aligncenter" src="https://ygbrandmaker.site/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/tips-to-consider-while-choosing-ecommerce-payment-gateway-image-1.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="377" srcset="https://ygbrandmaker.site/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/tips-to-consider-while-choosing-ecommerce-payment-gateway-image-1.jpg 750w, https://ygbrandmaker.site/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/tips-to-consider-while-choosing-ecommerce-payment-gateway-image-1-300x151.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px" /></p>
<h3>◊ Support of eCommerce platform –</h3>
<p>Initially check the support of payment gateway with your eCommerce platform. All the factors are secondary if it is not supported by your eCommerce platform. So you need to check whether it supports customers’ preferred payment methods. Customers are likely to purchase when the payment method is of their comfort. Another thing to check whether they integrate via an Application Programming Interface (API) or not. If so, this integration ready to use or not (does it still needs to be developed)? You also need to check if they offer a full site Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate.</p>
<h3>◊ Implementation cost –</h3>
<p>Before you implement a payment gateway on your eCommerce site for making transaction easy, you have to pay to several different parties like payment gateway provider, merchant bank account provider and your website provider. Understanding the fee structure of the service provider is essential before you finalize the payment gateway, as the hidden fees can degrade your profit level. It is preferable to lower these charges as much as it inflates the business bottom-line. Every gateway varies when it comes to fees, some have a monthly subscription fee for a fixed number of transactions while some charge a fee per transaction.</p>
<h3>◊ Compatible on all devices –</h3>
<p>According to the research of eMarketers, over past 2-3 years, approximately 15 percent of e-commerce sales were conducted on a mobile device, and customers are increasing steadily. When you are selecting payment gateway, make sure that you are able to provide an active checkout experience that is responsive to different mobile devices, and changes according to the size and resolution of a selected device.</p>
<h3>◊ Countries and Multi-Currencies Supported –</h3>
<p>If you are dealing with your eCommerce business globally (in multiple countries) then your payment gateway must have a multi-currency option for your international shoppers. Customers are more likely to purchase a product from a website if it supports their native currency. Also, it allows the business owners to charge their clients in their native currencies.</p>
<h3>◊ Security –</h3>
<p>Security of card payment data is a key aspect while selecting a payment gateway partner. As more customers are turning to online shopping, it is important that you offer them an experience that feels them safe with their data. Payment Gateway service provider should be level 1 compliant with the PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard). This assures they have attained the utmost level of card data security. Also, make sure your platform provides robust security features.</p>
<h3>◊ Automatic Billing Support –</h3>
<p>If you are selling services or products which require subscriptions, then you should go for payment gateway having an automatic recurring plan. With this feature, you can set up an automatic billing cycle for customers who operate on subscription. It is essential for companies with monthly payment plans. Therefore, non-profits have found utility in recurring billing, because it allows organizations to easily collect funds easily from repeat contributors.</p>
<h3>◊ Customer Support –</h3>
<p>What if your payment gateway is having some technical problem and your customers are not able to do payment for products/services on your site. Then here comes the requirement of support. Several payment services are also available which do not provide any customer support. Then, users need to follow manual instructions to fix a problem. To avoid that situation, ensure whether the provider offers live technical support, at least within standard working hours, so that you can quickly resolve any technical problems.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The payment process is the final step of sales in eCommerce store. If it is not favored by your customer then you are losing your business. It is such a critical part of your business that you can’t afford to take a hit-and-trial approach. But selecting and implementing the right payment gateway is not that tough if you understand your eCommerce business needs. By selecting the right payment gateway for your eCommerce business can have an immediate and positive influence on your customer’s experience and your profitability. The bottom line is to do proper research and consider the above-discussed factors before choosing the right payment gateway.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Smartphone usage has been increasing rapidly over the last few years. More than 60% internet users depend on their smartphones for internet access. It also fulfills the requirements of people by providing an app for everything: traveling, food, dating, finance, music, gaming, email etc. Before your imagination it is probably available for download. Every mobile user expects their device to respond quickly and give you the answers you need as soon as possible. The cost-effective options are available, which has led to an increase in dependency on smartphones. The ease of functionality and accessibility offered via these devices can be the reason of this smartphone addiction. According to sources if mobile app failed to work the first time then 80 percent people would retry only once or twice. About 18 percent people would give it more than two attempts. Therefore bad mobile app experience is likely to discourage users from using that app again. Contrary to the technology and the platforms that run them, what matters most to the users is their experience. But the basic user experience is ensured by the operating system in place, with iOS for Apple and Android for almost everyone else. As you read this blog, understand that user experience beats everything else when it comes to mobile.</p>
<p>This blog will talk about the pros and cons of Native and Hybrid application development. So, that you can decide the best approach of mobile app development which fulfills your business requirements.</p>
<h3>Native App Development</h3>
<p>Native application is defined when software or program has been developed specifically for a particular operating system of a smartphone. This app is built using software development tools (SDK) for a certain software framework, hardware platform or operating system. Like Android app built on Java platform using Java Development Kit, iOS app built using iOS SDK, Objective-C &amp; Swift and Windows platform require .NET. Most industries prefer having applications on iOS and Android platforms. These applications are developed based on the device’s operating system, utilizing technical &amp; UI/UX principles, which make the entire process more captivating, personal, and engaging for the user.</p>
<p>Thus, an end user is more likely to learn how to navigate and use the app faster. Native applications have the significant advantage of being easily accessible and utilize the built-in capabilities of the consumer’s device like a camera, GPS, address book. When a user takes pictures using the device’s default app, sends text messages, set reminders, or uses the device’s music app (inbuilt in phone), they’re using native apps. Native code is faster than HTML and JavaScript (used in Hybrid app development). As we know native app is designed for specific OS so it does not depend on open source libraries and platforms like Cordova and Ionic. Let’s have a quick summary of the pros and cons of Native app development:</p>
<h4> Pros –</h4>
<p>◊ Excellent performance<br />
◊ Better UX standards<br />
◊ More secure and safe<br />
◊ Full integration of device<br />
◊ Work without Internet connection<br />
◊ Amazing Look and feel of native apps</p>
<h4>Cons –</h4>
<p>◊ Higher development and maintenance expenses<br />
◊ No guarantee that apps will get accepted</p>
<h3>Hybrid App Development</h3>
<p>Hybrid application is defined as the program or software designed to serve multiple operating systems. This is native app only because it can be downloaded from platform’s app store like a native app. It can get access to all the native platform features. Hybrid web app is built using HTML5 and JavaScript, wrapped in a native container (loads most of the information on the page as the user navigates through the application) to make them work as a native mobile app. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, your mobile banking app etc are the common suspects of a hybrid app. One of the advantages is single code runs for multiple platforms.</p>
<p>Hybrid app is beneficial for enterprises, business groups and startups that are looking forward to reaching out to a greater number of people in a lesser amount of time. Hybrid apps can be hosted quickly and with greater ease as compared to Native apps. Here the plug-ins ensures that the OS compatibilities and hardware do not form a hurdle in the functioning of an app. In the world of hybrid app development preferred tools are PhoneGap/Cordova and Appcelerator Titanium, which assist developers to create HTML/CSS/JavaScript local files. These tools help in the curation of the hybrid app in a website framework and then serve to reconfigure the app tailored to meet the UI/UX design for the smartphone. Let’s have a quick summary of the pros and cons of Native app development:</p>
<h4>Pros –</h4>
<p>◊ Fastest development speed<br />
◊ Unified development<br />
◊ Offline support<br />
◊ Efficient scaling<br />
◊ Less development cost<br />
◊ Interactive components<br />
◊ Only one codebase to deal with</p>
<h4>Cons –</h4>
<p>◊ Slow performance<br />
◊ Poor UX</p>
<h4>The bottom line is…</h4>
<p>So, there is no end to the debate hybrid vs. native apps. Each development has clear and distinct advantages and disadvantages. In the case of Native app the initial investment is higher, but for a long-term an organization will save time and money. It provides an enhance user experience and an industry standard app performance. On the other side, Hybrid app may be appealing in the terms of investment (initial!), one source code, cross-compatible web technologies etc but for the long-term an organization will likely to spend more time fixing and modifying the app because of UI elements or performance driven issues.</p>
<p>After having the knowledge in detail about both native and hybrid approach the final decision is based on goals and priority of your business. Each business has its own approach to designing an application. So it entirely depends on you on which path to choose and follow so that you can raise your business revenue.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every business depends on its customer. Building an e-commerce store is not so easy if you don’t know how to manage your customers. Like retail stores a human is required to tailor the demands of a customer but what about an online eCommerce store? So you have to fulfill their high expectations in order to gain their trust. If you manage to cope up with them, your customers will see you as reliable and a professional player in the business. It is very well said, “Satisfied customers are the best source of advertisement.” Even if your eCommerce site is successfully established, but unable to get the kind of conversion rate as expected from the site. The reason can be considered as lack of attention on customer’s point of view. Customer visits your site to buy a product required. He expects certain things from your site before going on a checkout page. So let’s have a look at what customers expect in an eCommerce site –</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast Page Load Speed</li>

</ul>
<h3>1.Fast Page Load Speed</h3>
<p>Every second counts, when it comes to loading time. According to study, loading time is the major factor of page abandonment, because nobody likes to wait. Slow loading time is equal to slow customer service, and it puts potential customers off. Page loading time is the first contact customers have with your eCommerce store. It is the point for visitors to decide whether they want to continue their journey with you. If eCommerce site has slow speed then you are sending visitors to another e-commerce store or they will simply close the tab rather than wasting time for the page to load.</p>
<h3>2.Intuitive Navigation</h3>
<p>Customer’s potential is put off when they are not able to easily navigate through vast product selection. Obviously, many startups cannot afford to have a product selection like Amazon. Enormous selection is not necessarily required for a site. But navigating them effortlessly for what they want is a must. Too many choices often conflict customer into “decision paralysis”. Hence creating a navigational system that limits available choices prevents it by allowing customers to easily find what they are looking for, naturally increasing conversions on your eCommerce site.</p>
<h3>3.Social Media Connectivity</h3>
<p>Having social media pages can help you with free promotion. If you want to accomplish this then your pages should have interesting and strong content so that people want to follow you. Published ads may cost but this no-cost investment can give you guaranteed results. Social media links on product pages also help people to share products they like with friends or family. When some product is shared by a friend or relative it is more likely seen and purchased, as it is based on the recommendation. According to studies, 71% of consumers change their perception of the brand after seeing a brand response to a review.</p>
<h3>4.Mobile Responsive Design</h3>
<p>Gradually, People are shifting from desktops to smart devices for accessing online content. Some recent stats shows steady increase in conversion rates across all mobile devices. They are more likely to purchase from a site if it is easily accessible through their phone. It makes easy for a visitor to add products to cart via phone. To cater this potential customer base your eCommerce site should be responsive to all platforms regardless of its size and screen. So that customers can shop it from their comfort zone.</p>
<h3>5.Contact Information and Support</h3>
<p>For eCommerce store owner it is important to build and maintain a good relationship with customers. By building and gaining trust visitors can be transformed into loyal customers. A customer should feel like you are only a call, text, email, and live chat away. To build confidence in your customer you should have a passion for helping them. Make sure that there is always someone who can attend to help customers when they encounter a problem. So your site should display contact information so that customers can solve their queries easily. If your site hides contact information and other means of communication, customers see this as a red flag and not likely to do business with you.</p>
