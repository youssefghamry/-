										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>User experience plays an important role in any online store. If you provide a rich user experience to your visitor then in exchange you will get an increase in your revenue. You can do this with personalized content, improve conversion with fast checkout, and provide seamless shopper experiences across multiple devices at anywhere, anytime. Every e-commerce store has unique checkout page because they address a variety of requirements. Not all store owners or customers would require the same set of field that Magento offers. Then here comes the role of adding custom fields in the online store. By creating custom fields an owner can provide the fields that are required by the business or its customers.</p>
<p>This blog is about creating custom fields on checkout page in Magento 2. By adding these fields owner can know more about customers, their requests and feedbacks. Once the owner gets the more customer data then the better marketing strategy can be planned. The easiest way to obtain the customer data is to ask customers through custom fields at checkout page.</p>
<p><b>The coding starts here…</b></p>
<p>Create a new module with this folder structure. For instance, I have created a module with YGBrandMaker as Vendor name and Customcheck as the module name.</p>
<p><b>1. The path will be as follows app/code/YGBrandMaker/Customcheck</b><br />
<b>2. In this create a file registration.php with the following code –</b></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">\Magento\Framework\Component\ComponentRegistrar::register
(
  \Magento\Framework\Component\ComponentRegistrar::MODULE,
  'YGBrandMaker_Customcheck',
  __DIR__
);</pre>
<p><b>3. Now create a folder with name “etc” in Customcheck. Then create XML file in this. Path of XML file will be app/code/YGBrandMaker/Customcheck/etc/module.xml</b></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">&lt;config xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:framework:Module/etc/module.xsd"&gt;
  &lt;module name="YGBrandMaker_Customcheck" setup_version="1.0.0"&gt;
    &lt;sequence&gt;
      &lt;module name="Magento_Backend"/&gt;
    &lt;/sequence&gt; 
  &lt;/module&gt;
&lt;/config&gt;</pre>
<p><b>4. Now create a folder with name “frontend”. Place a XML file in it. Path of XML file will be app/code/YGBrandMaker/Customcheck/etc/frontend/di.xml</b></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">&lt;config xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:framework:ObjectManager/etc/config.xsd&gt;
  &lt;type name="Magento\Checkout\Block\Checkout\LayoutProcessor"&gt;
    &lt;plugin name="add_custom_field_checkout_form" type="YGBrandMaker\Customcheck\Model\Plugin\Checkout\LayoutProcessor" sortOrder="100"/&gt;
  &lt;/type&gt;
&lt;/config&gt;</pre>
<p><b>5. Create a folder with name “Model”. Again create folder in it Plugin -&gt; Checkout. In this create a file. The path of a file will be model/Plugin/Checkout/LayoutProcessor.php</b></p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">namespace YGBrandMaker\Customcheck\Model\Plugin\Checkout;
  class LayoutProcessor
  {

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today the internet is surging with spammers who are dying to get their hands on your servers. Spammers register an account on your site to brake into your system as it is a relatively easy way for amateur. It is one of the key parts of their spamming strategy. We cannot stress enough the importance of identifying spam domains and blocking them in advance because whether human or a bot machines, spammers would normally be using an email spam domain. You need to integrate your web store with additional anti-spam protection making definite email domains and zones blocked. If you allow your customers to use guest checkout, don’t forget it is hassle-free for spammers or hackers.</p>
<p>With Restrict Domain Registration feature you can block users from registering for accounts using email addresses from certain domains. This feature is useful for blocking spam and bots from logging into your website and it will effectively increase the security of the store. You can easily put the domains to block and set the error message to be displayed when a user attempts to register with an email domain on your block list. Full instructions are as follows –</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you may know, header is the key element of a website as it is the first thing that people will see when they land on your site. Basically, it contains links to important pages on your site that potential customers will often want to visit before making a purchase or enquiry. It sets the tone for the whole site. You need to include adequate information in the header to encourage your customers to explore your site further.</p>
<h3>In this blog today, we presented the way to Add Custom Header in Magento 2.</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-4639 aligncenter" src="https://ygbrandmaker.site/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-to-add-custom-header-in-magento-2-image.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="500" srcset="https://ygbrandmaker.site/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-to-add-custom-header-in-magento-2-image.jpg 800w, https://ygbrandmaker.site/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-to-add-custom-header-in-magento-2-image-300x188.jpg 300w, https://ygbrandmaker.site/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-to-add-custom-header-in-magento-2-image-768x480.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<h3>Step 1: Create an XML file on the following path –&gt;</h3>
<p>app/design/frontend/Vendor/Theme/Magento_Theme/layout/default.xml</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">&lt;referenceContainer name="header.container"&gt;
&lt;block class="Magento\Framework\View\Element\Template" name="custom_header" as="custom_header" template="Magento_Theme::html/customheader.phtml" before="-"/&gt;
&lt;/referenceContainer&gt;
&lt;move element="logo" as="logo" destination="custom_header"/&gt;
&lt;move element="top.search" as="topsearch" destination="custom_header"/&gt;
&lt;move element="minicart" as="minicart" destination="custom_header"/&gt;
&lt;move element="store_language" as="store_language" destination="custom_header" /&gt;</pre>
<h3>Step 2: Create HTML file on the following path –&gt;</h3>
<p>app/design/frontend/Vendor/Theme/Magento_Theme/templates/html/customheader.phtml<br />
Place this line in the code –</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;getChildHtml("store_language"); ?&gt;</pre>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-4640 aligncenter" src="https://ygbrandmaker.site/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-to-add-custom-header-in-magento-2-image-1.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="500" srcset="https://ygbrandmaker.site/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-to-add-custom-header-in-magento-2-image-1.jpg 900w, https://ygbrandmaker.site/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-to-add-custom-header-in-magento-2-image-1-300x167.jpg 300w, https://ygbrandmaker.site/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/how-to-add-custom-header-in-magento-2-image-1-768x427.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px" /></p>
<p>After placing the above code your new Header version is now applied. You just need to refresh your page and you can see it in the frontend.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Magento 2 is renowned eCommerce platform for its easy-to-use feature. Running an international business on Magento 2 doesn’t require much of technical knowledge. All you need is to make right use of admin panel of Magento 2 and be patient. Moreover, with Magento 2 configuration, you can set more than 20 currency units of the corresponding countries in the world. This blog will guide you through an example of business running in multiple currencies. This business operates across borders with customers from countries with different currencies.</p>
<p>Initially, you need to define which currencies will be allowed on your store. Let’s say our store operates in Arab, Canada, Germany, France, Japan, Singapore, China and our customers can pay in any of these countries’ currency. That currency symbol will appear in product prices and sales documents such as orders and invoices. If your store accepts multiple currencies, Currency Chooser should be available in the header of the storefront.</p>
<p>So follow the steps to know how you can import multi currencies in Magento 2 configuration.</p>
<h3>Step 1. Select the allowed currencies</h3>
<p>Open the admin panel and go into settings. Follow the path</p>
<p>Settings -&gt; Configuration-&gt; GENERAL-&gt;Currency Setup-&gt;Currency Options-&gt;Allowed Currencies</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-4629 aligncenter" src="https://ygbrandmaker.site/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/how-to-implement-multi-currencies-in-magento-2-0.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="377" srcset="https://ygbrandmaker.site/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/how-to-implement-multi-currencies-in-magento-2-0.jpg 700w, https://ygbrandmaker.site/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/how-to-implement-multi-currencies-in-magento-2-0-300x162.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<h3>Step 2. Select Currencies you want for Multistore</h3>
<h3>Step 3. Select Stores from dropdown list and Select Currency Store Wise From</h3>
<p>GENERAL-&gt;Currency Setup-&gt;Currency Options-&gt;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-4630 aligncenter" src="https://ygbrandmaker.site/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/how-to-implement-multi-currencies-in-magento-2-3.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="377" srcset="https://ygbrandmaker.site/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/how-to-implement-multi-currencies-in-magento-2-3.jpg 700w, https://ygbrandmaker.site/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/how-to-implement-multi-currencies-in-magento-2-3-300x162.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-4631 aligncenter" src="https://ygbrandmaker.site/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/how-to-implement-multi-currencies-in-magento-2-1.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="377" srcset="https://ygbrandmaker.site/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/how-to-implement-multi-currencies-in-magento-2-1.jpg 700w, https://ygbrandmaker.site/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/how-to-implement-multi-currencies-in-magento-2-1-300x162.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<h3>Step 4. After selecting the currencies of various countries fill their rates by following the path</h3>
<p>Stores-&gt;Currency -&gt; Currency Rates</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-4632 aligncenter" src="https://ygbrandmaker.site/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/how-to-implement-multi-currencies-in-magento-2-2.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="377" srcset="https://ygbrandmaker.site/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/how-to-implement-multi-currencies-in-magento-2-2.jpg 700w, https://ygbrandmaker.site/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/how-to-implement-multi-currencies-in-magento-2-2-300x162.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>The currency chooser should appear in the header of the store. If any fluctuation takes place in currencies then it can impact your business revenue. To assure that the currency import is done right, check the Currency Rates list. Then, wait for the duration of the frequency setting established for the schedule, and check the rates again. Hope you find this solution useful.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the numbers of online customers are increasing so the numbers of shopping sites are also increasing with the time. When there are a lot of options available for a customer to purchase then why would he purchase from your store. Ease of shopping feature can attract customer to your store. Here ease of shopping refers to multiple factors like variety in product size, color, variant, easy checkout process and many more. Like traditional way of shopping customers buy items and often discriminate based on its color or other attributes, same is observed with online shopping. Magneto provides the functionality to facilitate such shopping environment; this makes Magento the most popular ecommerce platform. Configurable Product is one of the ways Magento offers to cater these requirements. Due to this customer can select their desired variant of the product without having to browse numbers of product pages. SKU (stock keeping unit) is an identification, usually alphanumeric which is assigned to each product that allows it to be tracked for inventory purposes. While saving a configurable product with big length SKU a fatal error is observed</p>
<p>Notice: Undefined variable: product in /MASKED_DIR/2018-08-06_12-56-07/htdocs/vendor/magento/module-catalog/Controller/Adminhtml/Product/Save.php on line 156</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-4581 aligncenter" src="https://ygbrandmaker.site/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/big-length-sku.png" alt="big-length-sku" width="700" height="580" srcset="https://ygbrandmaker.site/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/big-length-sku.png 700w, https://ygbrandmaker.site/en/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/big-length-sku-300x249.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Recently our Magento experts have found a solution to eliminate this error. If you are facing such errors then kindly follow the steps given below.</p>
<p><strong>Step -1</strong> Initially, set “const SKU_MAX_LENGTH = 255;” in the file module-</p>
<p><code>catalog/Model/Product/Attribute/Backend/Sku.php</code></p>
<p><strong>Step -2</strong> You need to change the into database as well. Go to table</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic">eav_attribute,

</pre>
<p>search for SKU at column attribute code then edit the resulted row.<br />
Update the field frontend_class to null or validate-length maximum-length-255 according to your requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Step -3</strong> You have to change field size at the database table.</p>
<p><code>ALTER TABLE catalog_product_entity CHANGE sku sku VARCHAR(255) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci NULL DEFAULT NULL COMMENT 'SKU';</code></p>
<p>By implementing the above steps you can easily add the configurable product having big length SKU. Hope this solution works for you. If you have any better ideas please leave a comment below.
